## Intro to GitHub and Python Assignment

1. requirements.txt

- A `requirements.txt` file can be created manually and add the names of the modules we would like to install.
- To install the python packages from the `requirements.txt`, use the `pip` package management and navigate to the root directory of the program and type the following command in a terminal:

  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- The `requirements.txt` file can also be generated with `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`. This command outputs a list of all installed Python modules with their versions. NumPy library is required for the assignment and this command shows that NumPy was previously installed.
